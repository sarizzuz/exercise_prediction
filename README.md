# Practical Machine Learning - Prediction Assignment

## Overview

The goal of the project is to to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. This report will outline:

1. How the model is built.
2. How cross validation is used. 
3. What is the expected out of sample error. 
4. Rationale for the choices made.
